Tango is a robust language for specifying cellular automata.

Tango does not and cannot run on its own - an implementation of Tango should read in the source files and "transpile" them into a state machine written in the language of the implementer's choice.

This plan for this repository is to provide Java and JavaScript implementations of Tango, as well as a Java user interface for writing and running cellular automata using Tango.
